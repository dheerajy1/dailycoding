# Conditionals and Loops

## The switch Statement
- test multiple conditions.
- to perform different actions based on different conditions.
- syntax: `switch (expression) {
  case n1: 
     statements
     break;
  case n2: 
     statements
     break;
  default: 
     statements
}`

- In a way: Switch stands for 'if' Case stands for 'else if' Default stands for 'else'

### The break Keyword
- to come out of the code execution loop

### The default Keyword
- default statement is mandatory this will be executed when there is no match.
- there is no break keyword for default it is the last case which will be executed if there is no match.

## Loops
- when you want to execute a block of code repeatedly, you use loops.
- JavaScript hash 3 types of loops they are for loop while loop command do while loop.

### The for loop
- syntax: for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
   code block to be executed
}
- the classic for loop consists of 3 components or statements.
- statement one his optional, statement 2 is optional but you have to put break in the blockcode.
