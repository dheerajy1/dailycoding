# 1. Form validation 

- HTML5 includes attributes that enable form validation. 
- The required attribute, for example, can be added to an input field to make it mandatory to fill out.
- JavaScript can be used to perform more complex form validation.

## 1.1 Code: 
- Form and display input [[click](https://www.sololearn.com/compiler-playground/Wbbqv0Ffg03G)]

Note:

- The form will not get submitted if its onsubmit event returns false.
