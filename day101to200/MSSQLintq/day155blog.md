## a. Finding default Index fill factor

The easiest way to find and change the default fill factor value is from Management Studio, right-click the SQL Server and choose properties.

In the Server Properties, choose Database Settings, you should see the default fill factor value in the top section.

## b. changing default Index fill factor

You can change to a desired value there and click OK to save the changes.

The other option for viewing and changing this value is using sp\_configure.

# **6.  What is Replication?**

Replication is a feature in SQL Server that helps us publish database objects and data and copy (replicate) it to one or more destinations.

It is often considered as one of the High-Availability options.

One of the advantages of Replication is that it can be configured on databases that are in a simple recovery model.
