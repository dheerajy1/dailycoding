Today #day23 of #100daysofcode, I have completed 3 lessons and a practice program in JS, thus making the First module 1 complete in JS course. @Sololearn

## 1. Comments in JS
### what is a comment in JavaScript and why we need?
- A comment is a non-executable JavaScript instruction.
- Comments help you are code more readable.

### how to write a comment for *single line*?
- Add Two forward slash`//` to your code line.

### how to write comment for multiple lines or *JS block*?
- Add `/*` at beginning of line and add `*/` at end of the line.

## 2. Data Types
### i. what are the data types?
- data types of different types of values a program language can take input.
- JavaScript can handle many different types of data like numbers, strings, arrays.
#### Note:
   - In JavaScript you can redeclare the same variable name with another data type value.
   - `Var` isn't correct keyword. `var` is correct keyword in JS. Js is case sensitive.

### ii. String Data Type
- String data type in JavaScript stores string data value.
- you can store manipulate text in string data type.
- If you start a string with single quote then you need to end with single quote.
-`\` is an escape character.
Example:

```
var name1 = "My name is Dheeraj"
document.write(name1) \\My name is Dheeraj

var name1="<br>I am 'batman'"
document.write(name1) \\I am 'batman'

var name1="<br>I am \'Ironman\'"
document.write(name1) \\I am 'Ironman'

``` 
Code: [output](https://www.sololearn.com/compiler-playground/WQP3Gy2D5Puh)

### iii. Boolean datatype
- boolean data type returns true or false.
- the boolean value of zero null undefined empty string is false.
- the boolean value of real value is true.
