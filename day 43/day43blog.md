Today #day43 of #100daysofcode, I have completed 7.51 and 7.52 lessons and 'image slider' project code project in JS course. @Sololearn


# 7.52. event propagation

- The HTML DOM supports two methods of event propagation: bubbling and capturing.

- When an event occurs, the element order can be defined using event propagation. Which element's "click" event should be handled first if you have a `<p>` element inside a `<div>` element and the user clicks on the `<p>`element?

- In bubbling, the event of the innermost element is handled first, followed by the event of the outermost element. The click event of the `<p>` element is handled first, followed by the click event of the `<div>` element.

- When capturing, the event of the outermost element is handled first, followed by the event of the innermost element. The click event of the `<div>` element is handled first, followed by the click event of the `<p>` element.

### Note:

- Capturing goes down the DOM.
- Bubbling goes up the DOM.

## 1. Capturing vs. Bubbling

- The addEventListener() method allows you to specify the propagation type with the "useCapture" parameter.
Example: `addEventListener(event, function, useCapture)`

- The default value is false, which means the bubbling propagation is used; when the value is set to true, the event uses the capturing propagation.

Example: 
- `//Capturing propagation elem1.addEventListener("click", myFunction, true);`
      
- `//Bubbling propagation elem2.addEventListener("click", myFunction, false);`

- This is particularly useful when you have the same event handled for multiple elements in the DOM hierarchy.

# 7.53. creating an image slider

## 1. Image Slider
- Now we can create a sample image slider project. The images will be changed using "Next" and "Prev" buttons.
Now, letâ€™s create our HTML, which includes an image and the two navigation buttons:

## 2. code
- Image slider with title [[click](https://www.sololearn.com/compiler-playground/WyYbqopJNSKj)]
