Today #day27 of #100daysofcode, I have completed 2 lessons: 15,16 in module 3
and a practice program in JS. @Sololearn

# Conditionals and loops - module 3

## The else statement
- syntax: `else {
   // executed if condition is false
}`
- the else statement is created to tell JavaScript the if statement condition is false.
- you can skip the curly braces block code contains only one command line.

## The else if Statement
- the else if statement is used when you want to check another condition in execute a block of code other than the if statement condition and just else statement.
- syntax: else if {
   // executed if condition is false
}`
- you can write as many as else if statements you may want to.
