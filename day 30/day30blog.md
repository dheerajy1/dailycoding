# Break and continue
## Break
- break statement is used to come out of loop and continue executing the code block.
- break will terminate the complete\entire loop.

#### Note: 
- you can use return keyboard to return some value and break out of the loop inside of a function.

## Continue 
- Unlike break statement which terminates the entire loop, the continue statement will break only one iteration and continues with next iteration of the loop.
