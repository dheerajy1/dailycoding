 Objects

# adding methods

## Methods
- Methods are functions that are stored as object properties.
- syntax: `methodName = function() { code lines }`
- syntax to access method:  `objectName.methodName()`
- A method is a function, belonging to an object. It can be referenced using the this keyword.
- You can also define the function outside of the constructor function and associate it with the object.
- Note that it's not necessary to write the function's parentheses when assigning it to an object.
