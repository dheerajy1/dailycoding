As shown above, I created an HTML page for my backup calculator project.

# **CSS**

Use media queries to adapt your content to the view port,

I put a total of 6 media queries to make responsive to the view window, showing only 2,
```css
@media screen and (width<1475px) {
  .p1div {
    grid-template-columns: 16vw 7vw 10vw;
  }
}
@media screen and (941px<width<1460px) {
  .p1div {
    grid-template-columns: 17em 8em 10em;
  }
  .q4 {
    min-width: 18em;
  }
  .main-dropdownbox {
    min-width: 8em;
  }
  .q5 {
    min-width: 12em;
  }
}
```

# **JavaScript**

Now, I gonna dump my JS code

It consists of calculations for my project.

# **Problems**

Problem - 1

### Finally,

Fixed the responsiveness using media queries.

Lessons I learned, I didn't provide the min-width and max-width I will implement this concept in the next responsive design.

# Conclusion

I Finally Completed my re-coding of my Backup calculator project with a new design and colors and completely responsive to the view window and is mobile friendly as shown.

1.  JS code
2.  CSS media queries
3.  Lot of CSS
