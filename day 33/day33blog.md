- Javascript has alert prompt confirm popup boxes.
- an alert box is used to relay information to the user.
- user must click procede in order to close the alert box, so be cautious.

- a prompt box is use to take user input. 
- the user must click OK or cancel to exit the prompt box.
- the user clicks okay prompt will return input value hand clicking cancel will return null value.
- the prompt takes 2 parameters.
  - The first is the label, which you want to display in the text box.
  - The second is a default string to display in the text box (optional).
      Ex: 
            ```var user = prompt("Please enter your name",'noname?');
                  alert(user);
            ```
