Today #Day156 of #365DaysOfCode, I am Learning MS SQL Server Interview Questions.

# **7. What the different components in Replication and what is their use?**

The 3 main components in Replication are

1. Publisher,
    
    The publisher is the data source of a publication.
    
2. Distributor, and
    
    The distributor is responsible for distributing the database objects to one or more destinations.
    
3. Subscriber,
    
    The subscriber is the destination where the publisher’s data is copied/replicated.
    

# **8.  What are the differences in Clustering in SQL Server 2005 and 2008 or 2008 R2?**

On SQL Server 2005, installing SQL Server failover cluster is a single-step process whereas on SQL Server 2008 or above it is a multi-step process.

That is, in SQL Server 2005, the Installation process itself installs on all of the nodes (be it 2 nodes or 3 nodes).

In 2008 or above this has changed, we would need to install it separately on all the nodes.

i.e We nedd to install Clustering 2 times if it is a 2-node cluster or 3 times in a 3-node cluster and so on…

# Conclusion

This article discusses two MS SQL Server interview questions related to replication and clustering.

The components of replication are explained, including the publisher, distributor, and subscriber.

The differences between clustering in SQL Server 2005 and 2008 or 2008 R2 are also outlined.
