### arrays

# JavaScript Arrays

- Arrays store multiple values in a single variable.
- syntax: `var courses = new Array("HTML", "CSS", "JS"); `
- to access an array use the following syntax: `arrayname[arrayindex]`
Note:
- [0] is the first element in an array. [1] is the second. Array indexes start with 0.
- 1st element is 0th index. 10th element is 9th index.
- undefined value is returned when you access an index outside of the array.


# other ways to create arrays

- you can first create an array and then you can add the elements by later the referencing the index number.
- An array is a special type of object.
An array uses numbers to access its elements, and an object uses names to access its members.
Note:
- JavaScript arrays are dynamic you can declare an array without an argument inside the `()`, you can add any number of elements dynamically later.
