Today #Day152 of #365DaysOfCode, I am Learning MS SQL Server.

Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft.

It is widely used in the industry for data storage, retrieval, and management.

In this blog, we will cover the basics of MS SQL Server and how to get started with it.

# Day 1: Introduction to MS SQL Server

## 1\. What is MS SQL Server?

MS SQL Server is a relational database management system that is used to store and manage data.

It is widely used in the industry for its scalability, security, and performance.

MS SQL Server supports various programming languages such as C++, C#, Java, and Python.

## 2\. Versions of MS SQL Server

There are various versions of MS SQL Server available in the market, such as SQL Server 2019, SQL Server 2017, SQL Server 2016, SQL Server 2014, and so on.

Each version comes with new features and improvements.

## 3\. Installation of MS SQL Server

To install MS SQL Server, you need to download the installation file from the Microsoft website.

Once you have downloaded the file, run the setup wizard and follow the instructions to install the software.

## 4\. SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is a graphical user interface tool that is used to manage and administer MS SQL Server.

It provides a user-friendly interface to perform various tasks such as creating databases, tables, and views, querying data, and managing security.

## 5\. Creating a database

To create a database in MS SQL Server, open SSMS and connect to the server.

Once you are connected, right-click on the Databases folder and select "New Database".

From there, you can specify the database name, file location, and other options.

Once you have created the database, you can start adding tables, views, and other database objects to it.

## 6\. SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)

SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) is a tool that is used to develop and deploy SQL Server databases.

It provides a set of tools for database development, testing, and deployment.

You can use SSDT to create database projects, manage database schema changes, and deploy databases to different environments.

## 7\. T-SQL (Transact-SQL)

(T-SQL) is a programming language that is used to interact with MS SQL Server.

It is an extension of SQL and provides additional features such as variables, control statements, and error handling.

T-SQL is used to create database objects, query data, and perform database operations such as insert, update, and delete.

## 8\. Backup and Restore

Backup and restore are important tasks in MS SQL Server.

You can use the backup and restore features to create a copy of your database and restore it in case of a disaster.

MS SQL Server provides different types of backups such as full backup, differential backup, and transaction log backup.

## 9\. Security

MS SQL Server provides various security features to protect your data.

You can use authentication and authorization to control access to your database.

MS SQL Server supports different authentication modes such as Windows authentication and SQL Server authentication.

You can also use roles and permissions to control access to database objects.
